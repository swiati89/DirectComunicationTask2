Import project to IDE (tested and developed on Intelij). And then run previev from html editor in intelij.
There is a problem with import test data from local filesystem due to CORS policy in browsers when you try to run the code by
opening index.html. Asynchronous Ajax call will be a better method if there will be test endpoint.
