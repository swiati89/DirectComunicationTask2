<b>If you want to use other browser than Mozilla Firefox</b> import project to IDE (tested and developed on Intelij) and then run previev from html editor in intelij.
There is a problem with import test data from local filesystem due to CORS policy in browsers (chrome, safari) when you try to run the code by opening index.html. Asynchronous Ajax call will be a better method if there will be test endpoint.
